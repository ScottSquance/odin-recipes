<h2>Description</h2>
<p>We can thank the cuisine of Tex-Mex for the classic fajita. Originally, the term referred to a grilled strip of meat served in a tortilla. These days you can find steak, chicken, prawns or even vegetarian fajitas. Minimal prep and minimal cook time means these can be on your dining room table FAST. Top them off with sour cream, pico de gallo, and guac and for an extra special treat go ahead and make your own flour tortillas! If you like a little extra spice on your fajitas go ahead and add some chilli powder, cayenne, or paprika! </p>
